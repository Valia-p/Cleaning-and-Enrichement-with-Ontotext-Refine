# 🎼🎬 Movie Soundtracks as a Semantic Knowledge Graph

This repository contains the full implementation of my undergraduate thesis project, focused on transforming raw movie and music soundtrack data into a semantically enriched knowledge graph using Semantic Web technologies the Ontotext Refine tool. Τhe datasets used are publicly available on Kaggle:

- [Soundtracks of Top 250 IMDB Movies and TV Series](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ravineesh/soundtracks-of-top-250-imdb-movies-and-tv-series)
- [The Movies Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset)

## 📚 Project Summary

The goal of the project is to demonstrate how simple datasets can be transformed into expressive and interoperable knowledge graphs. Using tools such as **Ontotext Refine**, **GraphDB**, **SHACL**, and **SPARQL**, this work constructs and evaluates three levels of data enrichment:  
- **Raw**  
- **Enriched**  
- **Reconciled (linked to Wikidata)**

The graph is evaluated through reasoning, validation, visual exploration, and federated SPARQL queries.

## ⚙️ Technologies & Tools

- `RDF`, `OWL`, `SPARQL`, `SHACL`
- **Ontotext Refine** – cleaning, GREL, mapping, reconciliation
- **GraphDB** – semantic database, reasoning, query execution
- **Google Colab** – data preprocessing and transformation
- `Python`, `pandas`

You can explore the data preprocessing and enrichment process through the Colab notebook below:
